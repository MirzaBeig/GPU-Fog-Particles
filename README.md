Textureless fog particles for Unity using a highly customizable shader to attenuate multiple layers of noise. Works great as pseudo-volumetric atmospheric fog to add spooky and/or immersive vibes to your 3D levels.

## Compatibility

- Built-in pipeline + URP.
- Tested with Unity 2020.3 (LTS). 
- Shaders can be edited using Amplify Shader Editor.

## Installation

You'll find everything under Mirza Beig/GPU Fog Particles/...

Due to supporting both built-in and URP, you may get shader errors on import from the file that doesn't match your current pipeline. 
This is expected and not an issue. You can ignore these errors, or delete the offending shader if it keeps you sane.

## Usage

Drag and drop the prefabs into your scene.
The project is setup for the built-in pipeline. Replace the shader on the materials for URP.
